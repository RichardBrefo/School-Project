            <p class="first-sentence">My hobbies are a big part of my life. I love photography, playing the piano, and weightlifting. They have all helped me deal with stress and find balance in my life.</p>
            <p>Photography is my passion. I love capturing beautiful moments and sharing them with others. It's a great way to express my creativity and see the world in a different way. When I'm out taking pictures, I feel completely in the moment and forget about all my worries.</p>
            <p>Playing the piano is another hobby that helps me unwind. It's a great way to relax and clear my mind. When I'm playing, I'm completely focused and all my stress just disappears. I feel like I'm in a different world, and it's a great feeling.</p>
            <p>Weightlifting is something I've recently gotten into, and it's been a game-changer for me. It's a great way to release tension and stress. I love feeling strong and pushing myself to new limits. It's also a great way to stay healthy and fit, which is important to me.</p>
            <p>Overall, my hobbies have grounded me and helped me deal with stress. They give me a sense of purpose and fulfillment, and I'm grateful for them every day.</p>
