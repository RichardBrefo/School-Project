            <!-- Your existing content here -->
            <p class="first-sentence">The full name is Richard Nana Danso Brefo. I am of African descent, a Ghanaian to be exact.</p>
            <p>I immigrated to the United States at the age of 12 with my brother and mother. Looking back it was the best decision she ever made for us. We didnt have much to look forward to in Ghana.</p>
            <p>I attended several high schools in the States as I had to move around a lot, living with who ever was willing to accommodate my brother and I; my mom returned back home, Ghana to work. </p>
            <p>I graduated high school with an advanced diploma and a scholarship to William and Mary University. That offer fell through. I was not of Legal Status.</p>
            <p>My mom uknowningly had let my visa expire. I could and would not go back to Ghana either because I felt like The States was my home.</p>
            <p>I worked under the table, from job to job just like my older brother but we were always hopeful. Fast forward, I am a permament resident holder sponsered though marriage by my wife. </p>
            <p>I am quite happy how life has panned out for me. The struggles made me who I am today. I would not want it any other way. </p>
            <p>I am an uncle to my two beautiful neices now and the family keeps growing. I went back to Ghana to visit my mother for the first time in 17 years about a year and a half ago. I was 30 years old when I visited.</p>
            <p>I hugged her at the airport and told her I loved her. The words I picked out of her crying talking mixed with elation was - "Richard, you are going bald". </p>
            <p>I smiled and cried with her. Indeed I was. Fast forward to about nine months ago, I decided to return to school to pursue one of my goals; a Bachelor's Degree.</p>
            <p>I feel very fulfilled and believe that I am heading in the right direction. I have been blessed with the people that came into my life that helped me.</p>
            <p>A couple life lessons I learned is that, life is about family, friends and faith in God.</p>
